# Neo UI Library

Welcome to Neo UI Library, a collection of reusable UI components built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, styled in the Neo-Brutalism aesthetic.

This library is designed to provide eye-catching, high-contrast, and bold UI elements to make your projects stand out.

## Features

*   **Neo-Brutalism Design:** A unique and modern aesthetic characterized by:
    *   High contrast elements
    *   Bright, vibrant colors
    *   Bold shapes and typography
    *   Distinctive shadows (e.g., `shadow-[4px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,1)]`)
*   **React Components:** Built with React for easy integration into your projects.
*   **TypeScript:** Strongly typed for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.
*   **Storybook Integration:** Browse, view, and interact with components in isolation using Storybook.
*   **Copy-to-Clipboard Markup:** Easily copy the HTML/JSX markup for each component directly from the documentation site.

## Available Components

Currently, the library includes the following components:

*   Card
*   Button
*   IconButton
*   Input
*   Dialog
*   Checkbox
*   DropDown
*   ToggleSwitch
*   ProgressBar
*   Carousel
*   Breadcrumb
*   ComboBox

More components are planned for the future!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sai-Pratham05/neo-ui-lib.git

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or

### Running the Development Server (Documentation & Component Viewer)

The documentation site (built with Vite) allows you to view components and their markup.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Running Storybook

Storybook provides an isolated environment for developing and testing components.

```bash
npm run storybook
# or
yarn storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server, typically at `http://localhost:6006`.
